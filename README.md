# EmailGuard:  AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

The only secure and rational email phishing detector using advanced DistilBERT architecture for multilabel classification of emails and URLs.

## Model Architecture

**Base Model:** DistilBERT (Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Task Type:** Multilabel sequence classification
- **Framework:** Hugging Face Transformers
- **Fine-tuning:** 3 epochs using Trainer API
- **Input Length:** Maximum 512 tokens with truncation
- **Output Classes:** 4-class multilabel classification

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 99.58%
- **F1-Score:** 99.579
- **Precision:** 99.583  
- **Recall:** 99.58%

## Dataset

Trained on custom dataset `cybersectony/PhishingEmailDetectionv2.0` containing labeled emails and URLs classified as legitimate or phishing attempts.

## Classification Categories

1. **Legitimate Email** - Normal email communications
2. **Phishing URL** - Malicious web links
3. **Legitimate URL** - Safe web links
4. **Phishing Email** - Fraudulent email attempts

## Technical Implementation

The model uses softmax activation for probability distribution across classes, with the highest probability determining the primary classification. Input preprocessing includes tokenization with padding and truncation to maintain consistent input dimensions.
